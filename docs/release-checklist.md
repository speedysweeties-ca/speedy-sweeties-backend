# Release Checklist

Use this checklist for backend or dispatcher changes. Mobile app publication is
a separate release and requires its own signed build and store submission.

## Before opening the pull request

- Confirm the worktree contains only the intended release.
- Run `npm ci` and `npm run check` from the repository root.
- Run `npx prisma format --check` from the repository root.
- Run `npm ci` and `npm run check` from `speedy-dispatcher/`.
- Run `npm audit` in both directories and review every reported advisory.
- Confirm no production credentials, customer data, generated build output, or
  local environment files are included.
- Document any database migration, environment-variable, or rollout dependency
  in the pull request. State explicitly when there is none.

## Before merge and deployment

- Obtain explicit merge approval.
- Require the GitHub Actions checks to pass on the current commit.
- Reconfirm the production target and any required configuration.
- Identify the prior healthy commit so the code rollback target is known.
- Do not run destructive or production database commands as part of validation.

## After deployment

- Confirm the hosting platform reports a successful deployment of the expected
  commit.
- Verify `GET /api/v1/health` succeeds.
- Open the dispatcher and confirm authentication and live-order loading.
- Check recent production logs for startup errors and unexpected 5xx responses.
- Exercise the specific feature changed by the release with a non-destructive
  smoke test.
- Record any remaining physical-device or live-delivery field test separately;
  passing CI does not replace field verification.

## Rollback

If the service is unhealthy or the changed workflow fails, stop further rollout
and redeploy the last known healthy commit. Database rollback requires a
separate reviewed plan; never improvise a destructive production migration.
